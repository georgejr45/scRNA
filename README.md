# 📊 scRNA-seq Analysis Shiny App

Welcome to the **scRNA-seq Analysis Shiny App**, an interactive R Shiny application for analyzing and visualizing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. This app is designed to simplify exploration, quality control, clustering, and differential expression workflows commonly used in scRNA-seq analysis.

> 🚧 This project is in early development. Contributions, feedback, and feature requests are welcome!

## 🚀 Features (Planned)

- Upload and process `.rds` or `.h5ad` single-cell data files
- Quality control filtering (e.g., mitochondrial content, gene counts)
- Normalization and scaling
- PCA, UMAP, and t-SNE dimensionality reduction
- Clustering and marker gene detection
- Differential expression analysis
- Interactive plots using `plotly`, `ggplot2`, and `Seurat`
- Downloadable results and visualizations
